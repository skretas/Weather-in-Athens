## This project has 5 steps 

<hr>

### Obtain the data
- Data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/ 
and specifically https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search (2757512.csv)
- Check the completeness of the data.
- To fill in any missing data we will use an alternative dataset available from https://data.hellenicdataservice.gr/dataset/66e1c19a-7b0e-456f-b465-b301a1130e3f (athens.csv) this dataset covers only the period from 2010-2019.

## Deviation of Summer Temperatures
- The Hellenic National Meteorological Service has published a report on extreme weather events for 2020. The report is available at http://www.hnms.gr/emy/en/pdf/2020_GRsignificantEVENT_en.pdf. In page 7 of the report there is a graph showing the mean summer temperature deviation from a baseline of 1971-2000.
- We will create a graph, using a baseline of 1974-1999. The line that runs through the graph is the 10 years rolling avarege of the deviation from the mean.

## Evolution of Daily Temperatures
- We will get the average temperature for each year for the full period from 1955 to 2020. 
- We will then create a plot showing the daily temperature for each year. The line corresponding to each year will be smoothed by using a 30 days rolling average. 
- The lines are colored from light orange to dark orange, progressing through the years in ascending order.
- On that plot we will overlay a line showing the average daily temperature for the baseline period of 1974-1999 (that is the black line). The line will also be smoothed usng a 30 days rolling average.

## Extreme Temperature Events
- Another mesure used by climatologists is the number of extreme events. Extreme events are defined as those beyond 5% or 10% from the expected value. We will deal with extreme heat events going 10% above the baseline.
- We will count the number of extreme temperature events per year, compared to the baseline of 1974-1999. You should should produce a graph like the one that follows. The vertical axis is the percentage of extreme heat events calculated over the number of observations for each year. The gray line in the middle is the average percentage of extreme tempearture events of the baseline. The colour blue is used for those years where the percentage is below the baseline; otherwise the colour is orange.

## Precipitation
- Continuing the thread on extreme events, another consideration is rainfall. The weather may or may not be drying up. We are, however, interested in whether precipication becomes more intense over time.
- We will count the overall rainfall over the year and the number of rainy days in each year. Then, by dividing the rainfall by the number of rainy days you will get an indication of whether we are getting rain in more concentrated bursts. You will then create a plot showing the ratio of rainfall over rainy days over the years. On the plot you will overlay the 10 years rolling average
